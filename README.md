You can quickly set up your db if you go to ```/quick_setup``` page.

## Some info

- As an admin, you can add quizzes on ```/admin``` page.
- Your stats are saving in the local storage. I make collection ```user``` only for admin.
- It was supposed to be a simple vanilla js project, where quizzes are stored as an array of objects, but I've decided to slightly improve this.
